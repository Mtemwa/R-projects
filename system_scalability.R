# Example of using the scale_data_processing function
# Assuming `raw_data` is a dataframe loaded from your database or an external source
raw_data <- data.frame(id = 1:10, value = rnorm(10))
scaled_data <- scale_data_processing(raw_data)

# Placeholder for additional scalability features
# This could include implementing caching strategies, load balancing across multiple servers,
# or integrating with cloud-based services for elastic compute resources.

# Note: The actual scalability solutions would be highly dependent on the specific
# deployment environment (e.g., on-premises servers, cloud platform) and the
# expected load in terms of data volume and concurrent users.
